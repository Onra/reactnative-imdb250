## Why this app ?

[Because it's fun !](http://izquotes.com/quote/186212)

But seriously, React Native brings to Mobile developers a new way of doing serious native apps (don't event talk to me about Webviews...) in a short amount of time for every JavaScript hipster.

This app is just a little experiment and will probably never be published on Apple Store.
But feel free to fork it or to push some PR. :cool:

## What is React Native ?

In the words of the [official site](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) :

> React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms you care about â€” learn once, write anywhere. Facebook uses React Native in multiple production apps and will continue investing in React Native.
